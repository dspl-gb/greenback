# Code Architecture

This repo is a **starter foundation**: one worked vertical slice, the conventions
around it, and the CI/branching setup. Sections 1–3 describe what is here.
**Sections 4–9 are the ones to read before you write code** — they cover which
layer a thing goes in and what it should look like.

Onboarding is the reference implementation. Everything else is infrastructure
that exists to support it.

---

## 1. What this is

| Component | Runs on | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| Next.js 15 (App Router) | Vercel | PWA, all business logic |
| Supabase | Supabase | Postgres, auth, storage, realtime |

One app, one database. Additional services get added as separate deployables with
their own build — they do not get folded into `apps/web`.

---

## 2. Repo layout

```
├── apps/web/              Next.js — PWA, all domain logic
├── supabase/              Migrations, seed, local config
├── scripts/               Repo tooling
└── .github/workflows/     CI
```

**Tooling: pnpm workspaces.** No Turborepo or Nx — there is one app. The workspace
tracks `apps/*` only; add `packages/*` back when a package has two real consumers.

CI scoping uses path filters, so a second app or service can arrive with its own
workflow without slowing this one down.

---

## 3. `apps/web` — structure

```

```

Adding a domain means a folder under `lib/` with the shape in §4, a migration in
`supabase/migrations/`, and a test alongside. Nothing else in the tree changes.

### The rule

`app/` is screens and endpoints. `lib/` is logic.

- Pages call `lib/`. They don't query the database, hold business rules, or know
  about external providers.
- `lib/` talks to Supabase and external services. It's the only layer that does —
  and within `lib/`, only `queries.ts` and `service.ts` do. See §4.
- Components receive props and don't fetch.

### Rendering

Server Components by default — they call `lib/` directly, so no API round-trip and
no loading flash on first paint. Client islands only where you genuinely need
browser APIs, a live subscription, or interactive form state.

---

## 4. Where does my code go?

Start here. Find your case, use that layer.

| What you're building | Where it goes |
|---|---|
| Reading data for a page | Server Component calls `lib/<domain>/queries.ts` |
| A form in our own UI that writes | **Server Action** in `app/<route>/actions.ts` |
| An external system calling us | **Route Handler** in `app/api/<name>/route.ts` |
| A scheduled job | Route Handler in `app/api/cron/<name>/` |
| A rule that needs no database | Pure function in `lib/<domain>/` |
| Something drawn on screen | `components/` — props in, no fetching |

**Server Actions are the default for writes.** Route Handlers exist for callers we
don't control: provider webhooks, third-party callbacks, cron. If our own
React form is the caller, use an Action — there's no URL to secure, no fetch to
write, and no JSON contract to keep in sync.

### A domain folder

Each `lib/<domain>/` holds up to four kinds of file:

**Every domain uses the same six file names.** Open any two and they look alike:

```
lib/<domain>/
  index.ts      the public surface — the only file other domains may import
  types.ts      the nouns.        no infrastructure imports
  rules.ts      the decisions.    pure, no I/O, highest coverage bar
  schema.ts     zod contracts for anything entering the domain
  queries.ts    reads.            ← touches Supabase
  service.ts    writes.           ← touches Supabase
```

Not every domain needs all six — but when a file exists it has that name and that
job. Don't invent `helpers.ts`, `utils.ts` or `manager.ts`; if something doesn't
fit one of the six, that usually means it belongs in a different domain.

**The barrel rule.** Cross-domain imports go through `index.ts`:

```ts
import { getConsents } from "@/lib/consent";           // ✅ public surface
import { getConsents } from "@/lib/consent/queries";   // ❌ reaching inside
import { nextStep } from "./rules";                     // ✅ within a domain
```

If it isn't exported from `index.ts`, it's internal. This is what stops one
domain's refactor from breaking four others.

### Who may import whom

| From | May import | Must not |
|---|---|---|
| `app/**` | any `lib/*` barrel | another route's `_components/` |
| `lib/<d>/types.ts` | other domains' types | anything infrastructural |
| `lib/<d>/rules.ts` | own `types.ts` | Supabase, `next/*`, anything async |
| `lib/<d>/queries.ts` | `SupabaseClient` type, own types | another domain's internals |
| `lib/<d>/service.ts` | own files, other domains' barrels | `app/**` |
| `components/**` | domain **types** only | `queries.ts`, `service.ts`, Supabase |
| `lib/**` | — | `app/**`, ever |

The direction is one-way: `app/ → lib/<domain> → lib/config|errors`. If you find
yourself importing from `app/` inside `lib/`, the logic is in the wrong place.

### Not everything in `lib/` is pure — and that's the point

`lib/` is where I/O is **allowed and confined**. §3 says it's the only layer that
talks to Supabase; that is deliberate, and `queries.ts` and `service.ts` are the
files doing it. They are not pure and cannot be.

Purity isn't a goal in itself here. It's a technique for isolating *decisions*:

| File | Makes decisions? | Does I/O? | Coverage bar |
|---|---|---|---|
| `rules.ts` | Yes — what the domain means | No | High |
| `queries.ts` | No — fetches and maps | Yes | Low |
| `service.ts` | Yes, but needs the DB to decide | Yes | Medium, stubbed client |

The rule to follow: **push every judgement down into a pure function, and keep the
I/O layer thin and dumb.** `getConsents` should never grow an `if` about what
counts as valid consent — that belongs in `rules.ts`, where it is tested against an
array instead of a database.

You may reasonably ask why `queries.ts` isn't hidden behind a repository interface
so callers depend on an abstraction. Because it buys nothing we don't already have:
the client-as-parameter rule below gives tests their seam without a second layer of
indirection to maintain.

### The client-as-parameter rule

Every function in `queries.ts` and `service.ts` takes the Supabase client as its
**first argument** instead of importing one:

```ts
// lib/consent/queries.ts
export async function getConsents(
  supabase: SupabaseClient,
  accountId: string,
): Promise<Consent[]> { … }
```

Two reasons. Tests pass a stub instead of mocking module imports. And the caller
has to choose which client — which means choosing a security model on purpose
rather than by accident. See §5.

Queries return **domain types, never raw rows**. `snake_case` stops at the query
layer; map it there. `lib/accounts/queries.ts` shows the mapping.

### Building a page

**There is no SSR folder and no CSR folder.** Both live in the same directory. The
`"use client"` directive is the boundary — not the file's location.

Every `page.tsx` is a **Server Component**. Never put `"use client"` at the top of
a page. A page's job is three steps:

```tsx
// app/(auth)/onboarding/page.tsx  — Server Component, no directive
import { requireStep } from "@/lib/onboarding";
import { AgeGateForm } from "./_components/AgeGateForm";

export default async function AgeGatePage() {
  await requireStep("age-gate");     // 1. guard — redirects if they can't be here

  return (                           // 2. render; the form is a client island
    <div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
      <h1 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Confirm your age</h1>
      <AgeGateForm />
    </div>
  );
}
```

A page that needs data does the same with a fetch in the middle:

```tsx
const account = await getSessionAccount();            // 1. who is asking
const supabase = await createClient();
const consents = await getConsents(supabase, account.accountId);   // 2. fetch
const settled = hasRequiredConsents(consents);        // 3. decide — pure function
return <SomeForm settled={settled} />;                // 4. plain props down
```

The page holds no business rules, writes no queries inline, and names no Supabase
tables. It orchestrates. If a page grows an `if` about what something *means*, that
`if` belongs in `lib/`.

### If you're coming from a React SPA

In a client-side React app (CRA, Vite, React Native) the chain is:

```
Component → useAuth() hook → repository → fetch("/api/...") → server → DB
```

Every link exists for one reason: **the browser cannot reach the database**, so you
need an HTTP hop, and you need a hook to manage the loading/error/data states that
hop creates.

In the App Router the page already runs on the server. The hop is gone, and most of
the chain goes with it:

```
page.tsx (server) → lib/queries.ts → Supabase
```

| What you'd write in an SPA | Here |
|---|---|
| `useAuth()` hook | `getSessionAccount()`, called in the page |
| Repository / service class | `lib/<domain>/queries.ts` — same idea, runs on the server |
| `fetch("/api/balance")` | Nothing. The page calls the function directly |
| An `/api/balance` route | Only if an external system calls it |
| `useState` for loading | None. The page awaits before any HTML is sent |
| `useEffect(fetchOnMount)` | Delete it. Fetch in the server page |
| Global auth context/provider | The session cookie, read per request |

**Reads: before and after.**

```tsx
// SPA — three states, a hook, an endpoint, a spinner
function Profile() {
  const { user } = useAuth();
  const { data, loading, error } = useAccount(user.id);
  if (loading) return <Spinner />;
  if (error) return <Error />;
  return <p>{data.displayName}</p>;
}
```

```tsx
// App Router — no hook, no endpoint, no spinner, no loading state
export default async function ProfilePage() {
  const session = await getSessionAccount();
  const supabase = await createClient();
  const account = await findAccountByUserId(supabase, session.userId);
  return <p>{account.displayName}</p>;
}
```

The second one cannot render a stale or half-loaded state, because the data is
resolved before the HTML exists.

**Writes: the Server Action replaces the endpoint.**

```tsx
// actions.ts
"use server";
export async function createProfileAction(prev: FormState, formData: FormData) {
  const user = await getSessionUser();
  const parsed = CreateAccountSchema.safeParse(Object.fromEntries(formData));
  if (!parsed.success) return { status: "error", message: "Enter your name." };
  await createAccount(createAdminClient(), user.userId, parsed.data);
  redirect("/onboarding/consent");
}
```

```tsx
// _components/ProfileForm.tsx
"use client";
import { useActionState } from "react";

export function ProfileForm() {
  const [state, action, pending] = useActionState(createProfileAction, idleState);
  return (
    <form action={action}>
      <input name="displayName" />
      <button disabled={pending}>Continue</button>
      {state.message && <p>{state.message}</p>}
    </form>
  );
}
```

No `fetch`, no URL, no JSON contract, no `useEffect`. The function is imported and
called; Next.js handles the network.

**So where do hooks survive?** Three places, all genuinely browser-side:

1. **Form state** — `useActionState` for pending/error, as above.
2. **Realtime** — `useEffect` to open and tear down a Supabase subscription.
3. **Device APIs** — camera, geolocation, anything behind `navigator`.

Do not build a `useAuth()` hook. On the server, `getSessionAccount()` is the answer.
If a client component needs to know who's signed in, its server parent passes it
down as a prop.

### When a component needs `"use client"`

Add the directive only when the component needs one of these:

- `useState`, `useEffect`, `useReducer`, or any hook
- an event handler — `onClick`, `onChange`, `onSubmit`
- a browser API — camera, `localStorage`, geolocation
- a Supabase Realtime subscription
- a third-party library that uses hooks internally

**Push it as far down the tree as you can.** `"use client"` is contagious
downward: everything a client component imports becomes client code and ships to
the browser. One interactive button does not make the page interactive — extract
the button.

| | Server Component (default) | Client Component |
|---|---|---|
| Can be `async` / await | Yes | No |
| Can call `lib/` queries | Yes | **No** |
| Can use hooks and handlers | No | Yes |
| Ships JavaScript to browser | No | Yes |
| Can read secrets / server env | Yes | **Never** |

A client component that needs data gets it as **props from a server parent**, or
uses a Server Action to write. It does not fetch on mount. The only exceptions
are the browser-side cases listed above - a live subscription, or a device API
that has no server equivalent.

### Where components live

```
components/
  ui/         primitives — Button, Field        shared by 2+ routes
  feedback/   FormMessage, EmptyState

app/(auth)/onboarding/
  page.tsx                        server
  layout.tsx                      shared chrome for the flow
  actions.ts                      every server action for this route subtree
  _components/AgeGateForm.tsx     used only here
```

A folder prefixed with `_` is private — Next.js does not turn it into a route. Use
it for anything a single route owns. Promote to `components/` on the **second**
consumer, not in anticipation of one.

Components take props and render. They don't fetch, don't import Supabase, and
don't hold business rules.

### Creating an API route

Route Handlers are for callers we don't control — provider webhooks, third-party
callbacks, cron. **If our own React form is the caller, write a
Server Action instead.**

Every handler follows the same shape:

```ts
// app/api/<provider>/callback/route.ts
export async function POST(request: Request) {
  // 1. authenticate the CALLER — there is no browser session here
  if (!verifySignature(request)) {
    return Response.json({ error: "invalid signature" }, { status: 401 });
  }

  // 2. parse and validate
  const parsed = OcrCallbackSchema.safeParse(await request.json());
  if (!parsed.success) {
    return Response.json({ error: "invalid payload" }, { status: 400 });
  }

  // 3. delegate — no business logic in this file
  const result = await applyExtraction(admin, parsed.data);

  // 4. map result to status, and acknowledge fast
  return Response.json({ ok: result.ok }, { status: result.ok ? 200 : 409 });
}
```

Rules:

- **A Route Handler has no session.** Middleware protects browser navigation, not
  machine callers. Verify a signature or shared secret explicitly.
- **No business logic in `route.ts`** — it parses, delegates, formats a response.
- **Never import one route handler from another.** Shared behaviour goes in `lib/`.
- **Webhooks must be idempotent.** Providers retry. A second delivery of the same
  event must not apply the effect twice - check for the prior write before doing it.

### What belongs in `lib/`

`lib/` is everything that is not a screen or an endpoint:

| Belongs in `lib/` | Does **not** |
|---|---|
| Business rules and calculations | JSX |
| Supabase reads and writes | Hooks, `useState` |
| Calls to external providers | Route definitions |
| Zod schemas | `Response` / `NextResponse` |
| Domain types | HTTP status codes |

One folder per domain, named for the domain and never for the technical role — the
list is in §3. If you can't name the domain a file belongs to, that usually means
the logic belongs inside an existing one.

---

## 5. Which Supabase client — and the one that can hurt you

Three clients. Picking wrong is the most expensive mistake available in this
codebase.

| File | Key | Runs | RLS |
|---|---|---|---|
| `lib/supabase/client.ts` | anon | Browser | **Enforced** |
| `lib/supabase/server.ts` | anon + session cookie | Server, as the user | **Enforced** |
| `lib/supabase/admin.ts` | service role | Server only | **Bypassed entirely** |

Reads on behalf of a signed-in user should use `server.ts`, where RLS scopes the
result automatically.

**Writes have to use `admin.ts`,** because the schema defines no customer-facing
INSERT or UPDATE policies — every write through the anon key is rejected. That's
deliberate (see the closing comment in the initial migration): Next.js is the
single writer.

The consequence is the thing to internalise:

> On the admin client, **RLS is not protecting you.** A query without an explicit
> `.eq("account_id", accountId)` returns every user's rows. The filter you type is
> the only boundary there is.

And resolve the account from the **session**, never from a form field. A user can
put any UUID in a form; they cannot forge a session cookie.

`admin.ts` starts with `import "server-only"`, so importing it from a client
component fails the build instead of shipping the key to a browser.

---

## 6. Validation

Parse at the boundary, then trust the value.

```ts
// lib/auth/schema.ts
export const OtpSchema = z.object({
  phone: z.string().trim().regex(/^\+[1-9]\d{7,14}$/, "Include your country code."),
  token: z.string().trim().regex(/^\d{6}$/, "Enter the 6-digit code."),
});
export type OtpInput = z.infer<typeof OtpSchema>;
```

```ts
// app/(auth)/onboarding/actions.ts
"use server";

export async function verifyCodeAction(_prev: FormState, formData: FormData) {
  const parsed = OtpSchema.safeParse(Object.fromEntries(formData));
  if (!parsed.success) {
    return { status: "error", message: parsed.error.issues[0].message };
  }
  // …everything downstream receives OtpInput, never FormData
  const result = await verifyLoginCode(parsed.data);
}
```

Services take typed input. A function signature containing `FormData`, `unknown`,
or `any` below the action layer means validation leaked downward.

Shape and range belong in the schema. Rules that need the database — *has this
person already consented?* — belong in `service.ts`.

---

## 7. Errors

Expected failures are **return values**. Unexpected failures **throw**.

```ts
type Result =
  | { ok: true; receiptId: string }
  | { ok: false; reason: "below_minimum" | "insufficient_balance" };
```

"Below the minimum" is a normal outcome the UI must render, not an
exception. A Postgres connection failure is an exception — let it throw and hit the
error boundary.

Never swallow an error to return a falsy value; a silent failure in a write path is
worse than a crash.

---

## 8. Testing

Thresholds live in `apps/web/vitest.config.ts` and CI enforces them.

| Layer | Tested? |
|---|---|
| Pure logic (`lib/**/rules.ts`) | **Yes — the 90% bar applies** |
| `service.ts` | Yes, with a stub client |
| `queries.ts` | Only if it holds real mapping logic |
| Pages, actions, components | No — E2E covers the critical journeys |

Write the test in the same PR as the logic, not a follow-up.

`tests/onboarding/rules.test.ts` shows the house style: a fixture builder with
overrides, so each test displays only the field it cares about. It also shows what
`rules.ts` buys you — no mocks, no database, no async, and it still covers the
whole flow.

E2E (Playwright) is reserved for the few journeys that genuinely matter. Don't add
an E2E test for something a unit test covers faster.

---

## 9. Conventions

- **Files**: components `PascalCase.tsx`; everything else `camelCase.ts`.
- **Domain types** are hand-written, one file per domain: `lib/<domain>/types.ts`.
  **Generated Supabase types go in `lib/supabase/database.types.ts`** —
  infrastructure, not vocabulary. Keeping them apart is deliberate.
- **Generated row types never leave `queries.ts`.** Map a row to a domain type at
  the query boundary and pass the domain type inward. A service signature
  containing `Database["public"]["Tables"][…]["Row"]` means your column names have
  become your domain vocabulary, and every migration is now a refactor.
- **One door per value-bearing table.** If a table records money, points or
  anything else people will argue about, exactly one service writes to it and
  every other domain calls that service. Make it append-only, enforce that with a
  trigger, and correct by writing compensating rows rather than editing history.
- **Writes driven by an external callback are idempotent.** Providers retry. Key
  the write on something stable from the payload and check before inserting — in
  the service, not the caller.
- **Imports** use the `@/` alias (`@/lib/onboarding/rules`), not `../../..`.
- **Money is not a float.** Currency is `numeric(10,2)` in Postgres; counters are
  integers.
- **Every schema change is a new migration.** Never edit one that has been applied.

### Worked examples in the repo

**Onboarding is the reference implementation.** A five-step flow — age gate →
phone → verify → profile → consent → done — touching every layer. Read in order:

| # | Read this | To see |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `app/(auth)/onboarding/page.tsx` | **Start here.** The shape every page follows |
| 2 | `lib/onboarding/rules.ts` | Pure logic. The entire flow decided by four booleans |
| 3 | `tests/onboarding/rules.test.ts` | What pure logic costs to test: no mocks, no database |
| 4 | `lib/onboarding/queries.ts` | The only place the flow touches the outside world |
| 5 | `lib/onboarding/guard.ts` | One line per page, no branching duplicated |
| 6 | `app/(auth)/onboarding/actions.ts` | Every mutation in the flow, all the same four steps |
| 7 | `_components/AgeGateForm.tsx` | The client island — `useActionState`, no fetching |
| 8 | `app/(auth)/onboarding/consent/page.tsx` | A form with **no** client component at all |
| 9 | `lib/accounts/service.ts` | The four-step write, and why it's idempotent |

The thing to take from it: **`rules.ts` decides, everything else obeys.** The five
pages contain no routing logic — they call `requireStep()`, which asks one tested
function. Adding a step means editing `types.ts` and `rules.ts`, not five files.

Supporting cast: `lib/auth/session.ts` (who is asking), `lib/supabase/admin.ts`
(the service-role rules), `lib/config/serverEnv.ts` (fail at boot, not at 3am),
`lib/errors/` (the shared `Result` type), `middleware.ts` (session refresh).
